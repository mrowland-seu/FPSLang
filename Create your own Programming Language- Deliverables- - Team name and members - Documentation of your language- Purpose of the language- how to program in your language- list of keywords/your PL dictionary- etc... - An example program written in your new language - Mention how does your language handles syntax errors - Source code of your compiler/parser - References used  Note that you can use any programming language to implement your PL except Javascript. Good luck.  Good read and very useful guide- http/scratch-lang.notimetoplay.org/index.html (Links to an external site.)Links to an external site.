Create your own Programming Language:
Deliverables:
- Team name and members
- Documentation of your language: Purpose of the language, how to program in your language, list of keywords/your PL dictionary, etc...
- An example program written in your new language
- Mention how does your language handles syntax errors
- Source code of your compiler/parser
- References used

Note that you can use any programming language to implement your PL except Javascript. Good luck.
